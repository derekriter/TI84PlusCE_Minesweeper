# TI-84 Plus CE Minesweeper
Just a small project I figured I would mess around with after playing *[Minesweeper](https://www.ti84calcwiz.com/ti84plusce-games/#:~:text=Download!-,Minesweeper,-Author%3A%20merthsoft%0AThe)* by merthsoft. It uses *[CE C/C++ Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain)* to be able to run C code on a TI-84 Plus CE.

# Installation
### Things you need
1. A TI-84 Plus CE.
2. A cable to connect your calculator to your computer (the charging cable it comes with works fine).
3. A computer.
4. *[TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/product-resources/ti-connect-ce-get-the-right-version#:~:text=your%20graphing%20calculator.-,TI%20Connect%E2%84%A2%20CE%20software,-Computer%20software%20for)*. This is the software used to transfer the game files to your calculator.
5. The ability to follow instructions.

### Steps
1. Go to the latest release, and download the attached MSWPR.8xp
2. Plug in your calculator to your computer.
3. Open TI Connect CE and navigate to the second tab on the left sidebar (it looks like a stack of papers).
4. Open file explorer (or the appropriate files app for your OS), and drag MSWPR.8xp into the app.
5. A popup will appear. The default settings should fine.
6. Press send.
7. You can now launch the game from your calculator. The game should be named MSWPR. To launch it, you must either have an older OS installed on your calculator, or use a jailbreak to regain the ability to run assembly programs. I recommenmd using *[arTIfiCE](https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/)* then installing a shell such as *[Cesium](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium/releases)* to easily and more quickly launch assembly programs.
